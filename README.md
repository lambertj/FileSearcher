# FileSearcher
Utility to search for files. Just that!
Speed is compared quite some time ago with Total Commander. This application was faster :).
The duplicate check has a nifty trick to have high performance.

**Features**
* Very fast search for files based on:
  * File name (wildcards or regex)
  * Attributes and size
  * Inside ZIP files
  * Content of files
  * Find duplicate files
* Find Visual Studio projects (*.csproj) which uses a particular .dll. This is very useful for finding project what are using some NuGet packages.
* Write custom logic to match files, in PowerShell! (Template included)

**Installation**

Install it via command line, simply by running it with the "/i" argument. Of course "/u" will uninstall it.
